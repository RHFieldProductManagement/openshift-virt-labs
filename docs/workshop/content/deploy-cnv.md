OpenShift virtualisation is available as both upstream (**KubeVirt**) and downstream releases. As of this writing the downstream release is version 2.3 and is available from the OperatorHub. This version is desginated with "[technology preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview)" status from Red Hat. 

The mechanism for installation is to utilise the operator model and deploy via the OpenShift Operator Hub (Marketplace) in the web-console. Note, it's entirely possible to deploy via the CLI should you wish to do so, but we're not documenting that mechanism here.

From within the lab guide window you'll see a button in the middle at the top that allows you to switch between the terminal and console options. Select the console and you should see the OpenShift dashboard:

<img  border="1" src="img/console-button.png"/>

Next, navigate to the top-level '**Operators**' menu entry, and select '**OperatorHub**'. This lists all of the available operators that you can install from the Red Hat Marketplace. Simply start typing '**virtualization**' in the search box and you should see an entry called "Container-native virtualization". 

<img  border="1" src="img/cnv-operator-panel.png"/>

Select it and you'll see a window that looks like the following:

<img  border="1" src="img/cnv-operator2.png"/>

Next you'll want to select the 'Install' button, which will take you to a second window where you'll be creating an 'Operator Subscription'. Leave the defaults here as they'll automatically select the latest version of OpenShift virtualisation and will allow the software to be installed automatically:

<img  border="1" src="img/cnv-subscribe2.png"/>

Make sure that the namespace it will be installed to is "**openshift-cnv**" - it should be the default entry, but make sure. When you're ready, press the **'Subscribe'** button. After a minute or two you'll see that the subscription has been configured successfully:

<img  border="1" src="img/cnv-installed2.png"/>

Next we need to actually deploy all of the CNV components that this subscription provides. Select the "**Container-native virtualization**" link under the '**Name**' column, and you'll be presented with the following:

<img  border="1" src="img/install-hco2.png"/>

From here, select '**Create Instance**' on the '**CNV Operator Deployment**' button. You'll be presented with the '**Create HyperConverged Cluster**' screen. This will deploy all of the necessary components that are required to support OpenShift virtualisation. Click the '**Create**' button.

<img  border="1" src="img/install-hco-create.png"/>

The '**kubevirt-hyperconverged**' operator will begin to install.

<img  border="1" src="img/install-kubevirt-hco.png"/>

You can follow the install by moving to the **Workloads** -> **Pods** menu on the left. Choose **Filter** and select **Pending** to watch the pods deploy.

<img  border="1" src="img/install-kubevirt-hco-pending.png"/>

You can also return to the 'terminal' tab in your hosted lab guide and watch via the CLI:

~~~bash
$ watch -n2 'oc get pods -n openshift-cnv'
(...)
~~~

> **NOTE**: It may take a few minutes for the pods to start up properly. Press **Ctrl+C** to exit the watch command.

During this process you will see a lot of pods create and terminate, which will look something like the following depending on when you view it; it's always changing:

<img src="img/deploy-cnv-watch2.png"/>

This will continue for some time, depending on your environment.

You will know the process is complete when you can return to the terminal and see that the operator installation has been successful by running the following command:

~~~bash
$ oc get csv -n openshift-cnv
NAME                                      DISPLAY                           VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE
kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v2.3.0   Container-native virtualization   2.3.0                Succeeded
~~~

If you do not see `Succeeded` in the `PHASE` column then the deployment may still be progressing, or has failed. You will not be able to proceed until the installation has been successful. Once the `PHASE` changes to `Succeeded` you can validate that the required resources and the additional components have been deployed across the nodes. First let's check the pods deployed in the `openshift-cnv` namespace:

~~~bash
$ oc get pods -n openshift-cnv
NAME                                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

> **NOTE**: All pods shown from this command should be in the `Running` state. You will have many different types, the above snippet is just an example of the output at one point in time, you may have more or less at any one point. Below we discuss some of the pod types and what they do.


Together, all of these pods are responsible for various functions of running a virtual machine on-top of OpenShift/Kubernetes. See the table below that describes some of the various different pod types and their function:

| Pod Name                             | Pod Responsibilities |

There's also a few custom resources that get defined too, for example the `NodeNetworkState` (`nns` for short) definitions that can be used with the `nmstate-handler` pods to ensure that the NetworkManager state on each node is configured as required. This is used for easily defining interfaces/bridges on each of the machines allowing connectivity for both the physical machine itself and for providing network access for pods (and virtual machines) within OpenShift/Kubernetes:

~~~bash
$ oc get nns -A
NAME                     AGE
ocp-9pv98-master-0       8m49s
ocp-9pv98-master-1       8m51s
ocp-9pv98-master-2       8m49s
ocp-9pv98-worker-g78bj   8m49s
ocp-9pv98-worker-pj2dn   8m49s
~~~

Dive a little deeper into the config on one of the workers:

~~~bash

Here you can see the current state of the node (some of the output has been cut), the interfaces attached, and their physical/logical addresses. In a later section we're going to be modifying the network node state by applying a new configuration to allow nodes to utilise another interface to provide pod networking via a **bridge**. We will do this via a `NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment` or `nnce` in short:

~~~bash
$ oc get nnce -n openshift-cnv
No resources found in openshift-cnv namespace.
~~~

As we've not set any additional configuration at this stage, it's perfectly normal to have 'no resources found' in the output above. We are going to build this in a later lab!


### Viewing the OpenShift virtualisation Dashboard

When OpenShift virtualisation is deployed it adds additional components to OpenShift's web-console so you can interact with objects and custom resources defined by OpenShift virtualisation, including `VirtualMachine` types. If you select the `Console` button at the top of this pane you should see the web-console displayed. You can now navigate to "**Workloads**" --> "**Virtualization**" on the left-hand side panel and you should see the new component for OpenShift Virtualization. Of course there aren't any Virtual Machines running yet.

<img src="img/cnv-dashboard.png"/>

**Please don't try and create any virtual machines just yet, we'll get to that shortly. We have to set up Storage and Networking first.**
